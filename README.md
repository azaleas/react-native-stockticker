**Stockticker App**

My first React Native implementation. Stockticker app uses https://www.quandl.com API to get the historic stock data. Currently getting the data from the following datasets:

 - [Wiki EOD Stock Prices](https://www.quandl.com/data/WIKI) 
 - [Swiss Exchange](https://www.quandl.com/data/SIX)
 - [National Stock Exchange of India](https://www.quandl.com/data/NSE)

What's implemented:

 1. API endpoints
 2. Basic design (Wasn't the main concern)
 3. Lists with 1000 and more entries
 4. Search bar with autocomplete for presented lists of data
 5. Separate Views for Charts (Line and Bar Charts)

**Current version for Android Only.**

What's learned and used:

 1. Implement Android App with React Native
 2. Create multiple Views
 3. Create Routing & Navigation
 4. Adding third party libraries (Charting Library)
 5. Contributed to another project (Charting Library)
 6. Setting up the API endpoints
 7. Managing big ListViews and optimizing them for better performance

What to do:

 1. Add the screenshots
 2. Add responsiveness
 3. Cleanup the code
 4. Comment/document the functions
 5. Rewrite the project parts to better comply with React writing standarts
 6. Add iOS support

***Current project was tested on android emulator, using Genymotion. Tested on Nexus 6p with Android 6 emulator.***
